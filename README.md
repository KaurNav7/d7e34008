# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Deployment Link - https://navdeepassignment-navdeepkaurs-projects.vercel.app/

I developed this application from the ground up. Initially, I worked with Node.js version 16 but encountered deployment challenges on Vercel and Netlify due to dependencies. Subsequently, I transitioned to my brother's laptop, which runs Node.js version 20, and rebuilt the application entirely from scratch.

The application features two primary buttons: 'Feed' and 'Archive Call'. Additionally, there is a centralized 'Archive All' button located at the bottom, which, when clicked, archives all calls. Similarly, this button is available on the archive page, where it unarchives all calls.

Clicking on any individual call navigates to a detailed call information page.
